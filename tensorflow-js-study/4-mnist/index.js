// input to the next layer.
const model = tf.sequential()

// The first layer of the convolutional neural network plays a dual role:
// it is both the input layer of the neural network and a layer that performs
// the first convolution operation on the input. It receives the 28x28 pixels
// black and white images. This input layer uses 8 filters with a kernel size
// of 5 pixels each. It uses a simple RELU activation function which pretty
// much just looks like this: __/

    kernelSize: 5,
    filters: 32,
    strides: 1,
    activation: 'relu',
    kernelInitializer: 'varianceScaling'
  })
)

// After the first layer we include a MaxPooling layer. This acts as a sort of
// downsampling using max values in a region instead of averaging.
// https://www.quora.com/What-is-max-pooling-in-convolutional-neural-networks

// it for input into our last layer. This is common practice when feeding
// higher dimensional data to a final classification output layer.

// output class (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Here the classes actually
// represent numbers, but it's the same idea if you had classes that represented
// other entities like dogs and cats (two output classes: 0, 1).

// creates a probability distribution over our 10 classes so their output values
// sum to 1.

// Now that we've defined our model, we will define our optimizer. The optimizer
// will be used to optimize our model's weight values during training so that
// we can decrease our training loss and increase our classification accuracy.

// The learning rate defines the magnitude by which we update our weights each
// training step. The higher the value, the faster our loss values converge,
// but also the more likely we are to overshoot optimal parameters
// when making an update. A learning rate that is too low will take too long to
// find optimal (or good enough) weight parameters while a learning rate that is
// too high may overshoot optimal parameters. Learning rate is one of the most
// important hyperparameters to set correctly. Finding the right value takes
// practice and is often best found empirically by trying many values.

// This is the most famous modern optimization algorithm in deep learning and
// it is largely to thank for the current machine learning renaissance.

// Momentum) are variants on SGD. SGD is an iterative method for minimizing an
// objective function. It tries to find the minimum of our loss function with
// respect to the model's weight parameters.

// classification problem like MNIST digits.

// examples we group together, or batch, between updates to the model's weights
